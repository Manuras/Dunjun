# Dunjun - Mac OS X #
Mac OS X support for Dunjun is experimental at the moment and has only been tested on my own computer (OS X 10.10.2)

To compiler, GLEW and GLFW must be installed either through `brew` or something similar.

You may have to adjust the `Makefile_OSX` to get it to work for your needs.
